# TryHackMe - IAAAIDM Room

## Overview
This room covers the fundamental concepts of **Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability, and Identity Management (IAAAIDM)**. It provides practical insights and hands-on activities to understand how these security principles are applied in various systems.

## What I Learned
1. **Identification**:
    - Understanding how systems identify users (e.g., usernames, email).
    - Importance of unique identification for system security.
  
2. **Authentication**:
    - Verified usersâ€™ identities using credentials (passwords, biometrics).
    - Different methods of authentication: passwords, PINs, biometrics, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

3. **Authorization**:
    - How systems determine what authenticated users can access.
    - Concepts of role-based access control (RBAC) and how access levels are granted based on user roles.

4. **Accountability**:
    - The importance of logging and monitoring to track user actions.
    - Using logging systems to detect and audit unauthorized access or malicious activity.

5. **Identity Management**:
    - Managing user identities and permissions efficiently within a system.
    - The role of Identity and Access Management (IAM) tools in maintaining system security.

## Accomplishments
- Successfully completed all hands-on exercises related to the IAAAIDM model.
- Implemented basic identity and access controls in a simulated environment.
- Reviewed logs to understand user activity and detect unauthorized attempts.
- Applied the principles of identification, authentication, and authorization in securing a system.

## Tools Used
- **Linux Command Line**: For system commands and log analysis.
- **IAM Platforms**: Explored IAM tools and their role in identity management.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilized logging mechanisms to track user actions and ensure accountability.

## Conclusion
The TryHackMe IAAAIDM room provided a comprehensive introduction to the security principles of Identification, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability, and Identity Management. The knowledge and skills gained will help in securing systems and managing user access efficiently.
